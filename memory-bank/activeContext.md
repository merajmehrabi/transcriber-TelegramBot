# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on implementing comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities, along with whitelist-based access control. Recent additions include:

1. Logging System
   - Daily rotating log files
   - Multiple log levels
   - Structured logging format
   - Sensitive data redaction

2. Access Control
   - Whitelist management
   - Admin commands
   - User validation
   - Command restrictions

3. Debug Functionality
   - Toggle debug mode
   - Detailed logging
   - Performance tracking
   - Error monitoring

## Recent Changes

### 1. Logger Implementation
- Added structured logging system
- Implemented log rotation
- Added debug mode toggle
- Enhanced error tracking

### 2. Whitelist System
- Added user access control
- Implemented admin commands
- Created whitelist management
- Added security logging

### 3. Documentation
- Created memory bank structure
- Documented system patterns
- Added technical context
- Tracked progress

## Active Decisions

### 1. Logging Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement daily rotating logs with structured format
- **Reason**: Better organization and easier parsing
- **Impact**: Improved debugging and monitoring
- **Status**: Implemented

### 2. Access Control
- **Decision**: Use whitelist with admin management
- **Reason**: Better security and control
- **Impact**: Limited access to authorized users
- **Status**: Implemented

### 3. Debug Mode
- **Decision**: Admin-controlled debug toggle
- **Reason**: On-demand detailed logging
- **Impact**: Better troubleshooting
- **Status**: Implemented

## Current Considerations

### 1. Performance
- Monitor memory usage with large files
- Optimize temporary file handling
- Improve cleanup processes

### 2. Security
- Regular security audits
- Token protection
- Data sanitization

### 3. User Experience
- Command response times
- Error message clarity
- Language support accuracy

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. Test logging system thoroughly
2. Monitor whitelist functionality
3. Verify debug mode operation

### Short-term
1. Implement rate limiting
2. Add user statistics
3. Enhance error handling

### Medium-term
1. External proofreading integration
2. Performance optimization
3. Enhanced monitoring

## Notes
- Keep monitoring memory usage
- Watch for log file growth
- Track unauthorized access attempts
- Monitor transcription accuracy

## Questions to Address
1. How to handle very large audio files?
2. Best approach for rate limiting?
3. How to optimize memory usage?
4. Strategy for log rotation?

## Dependencies to Watch
1. Grammy framework updates
2. Google Speech-to-Text API changes
3. FFmpeg version compatibility
4. Node.js security updates
